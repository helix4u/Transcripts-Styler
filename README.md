## üîß Setup & Configuration

### API Keys Setup
The extension requires API keys for LLM and TTS functionality. **Keys are stored in memory only** and are never persisted to disk.

#### OpenAI Setup
1. Get an API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. In the extension overlay, select "OpenAI" as provider
3. Enter your API key in the "API Key" field
4. Set Base URL to `https://api.openai.com` (default)
5. Choose a model (e.g., `gpt-4`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`)

#### Anthropic Setup
1. Get an API key from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. Select "Anthropic" as provider
3. Enter your API key
4. Set Base URL to `https://api.anthropic.com` (default)
5. Choose a model (e.g., `claude-3-sonnet-20240229`)

#### OpenAI-Compatible Setup (Local Models)
For local models using Ollama, LM Studio, or similar:
1. Select "OpenAI-Compatible" as provider
2. Set Base URL to your local server (e.g., `http://localhost:11434`)
3. Enter any API key (can be dummy for local servers)
4. Set the model name as configured in your local setup

### TTS Setup

#### OpenAI TTS
- Use the same API key as LLM setup
- Available voices: `alloy`, `echo`, `fable`, `onyx`, `nova`, `shimmer`

#### Azure Speech Services

## üìñ Usage Guide

### Basic Workflow

1. **Navigate to Supported Platform**
   - Open any YouTube video with captions (more platforms coming soon)
   - The overlay will appear automatically

2. **Extract Transcript**
   - Click "Detect" to auto-detect the video ID
   - Click "List Tracks" to see available caption languages
   - Select your preferred track
   - Click "Fetch Transcript" to load the captions

3. **Configure AI Styling**
   - Set up your LLM provider (API key, model, etc.)
   - Choose a style preset or create custom prompts
   - Adjust concurrency settings (1-10 parallel requests)
   - Enable ASCII-only mode if needed

4. **Restyle Transcript**
   - Click "Restyle All" to begin AI processing
   - Monitor progress in real-time
   - Use "Stop" to cancel if needed

5. **Generate TTS (Optional)**
   - Enable TTS and configure provider
   - Click "Generate TTS" to create audio
   - Play inline or download the audio file

6. **Export Results**
   - Choose from TXT, SRT, VTT, or JSON formats
   - Files include both original and restyled text

### Advanced Features

#### Custom Prompts
Use template variables in your prompts:
- `{{style}}` - The selected style preset
- `{{outlang}}` - Output language selection
- `{{currentLine}}` - The line being processed
- `{{prevLines}}` - Context from previous lines
- `{{nextLines}}` - Context from following lines

Example custom prompt:
```
Rewrite this transcript line to be {{style}} in {{outlang}}. 
Maintain the original meaning while improving clarity.

Previous context: {{prevLines}}
Current line: {{currentLine}}
Next context: {{nextLines}}
```

#### ASCII Sanitization
When enabled, this feature:
- Removes accented characters and special symbols
- Applies OpenAI logit bias to prevent Unicode output
- Uses a customizable blocklist for additional characters
- Helpful for systems that don't support Unicode properly

#### Language Preferences
Set preferred languages (comma-separated) to automatically sort transcript tracks:
```
en,es,fr,de,ja
```

#### Preset Management
- Save current settings as named presets
- Export presets as JSON files for sharing
- Import presets from JSON files
- Useful for different use cases or sharing team configurations

## üé® Customization

### Themes
- **Dark**: Default dark theme optimized for low-light usage
- **Light**: Clean light theme for bright environments  
- **System**: Automatically matches your system theme preference

### Overlay Position
- Drag the overlay by clicking and dragging the header
- Position is automatically saved and restored
- Resize using the corner handle (bottom-right)

### Style Presets
Choose from built-in presets or create custom ones:
- **Clean & Professional**: Formal, clear language
- **Casual & Conversational**: Relaxed, friendly tone
- **Academic & Formal**: Scholarly, precise language
- **Creative & Engaging**: Dynamic, interesting phrasing
- **Technical & Precise**: Detailed, accurate terminology

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "No transcript data loaded"
- Ensure the video has captions available
- Try different language tracks
- Some videos may not have captions

#### "API key required" or authentication errors
- Verify your API key is correct and active
- Check that your account has sufficient credits/quota
- Ensure the base URL is correct for your provider

#### TTS generation fails
- Verify TTS provider settings
- Check API key and region (for Azure)
- Try reducing text length for large transcripts

#### Extension not appearing
- Refresh the YouTube page
- Check that the extension is enabled in Chrome
- Verify you're on a YouTube watch page (not homepage)

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging to troubleshoot issues:
1. Check "Debug Logging" in the overlay header
2. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
3. Check the Console tab for detailed logs
4. Look for messages prefixed with `[YTS-UI]` or `[YTS-BG]`

### Performance Tips
- Use lower concurrency (1-3) for rate-limited APIs
- Break large transcripts into smaller segments
- Enable ASCII-only mode to reduce processing complexity
- Close other browser tabs to free up memory

## üîê Privacy & Security

### Data Handling
- **API Keys**: Stored in memory only, never persisted to disk
- **Transcripts**: Processed locally, sent to chosen LLM provider only
- **Preferences**: Saved locally using Chrome's storage API
- **No Telemetry**: Extension doesn't collect or transmit usage data

### API Provider Considerations
- OpenAI: Data may be used for training unless opted out
- Anthropic: Data not used for training by default
- Local Models: Data stays completely local

### Permissions Explained
- `storage`: Save preferences and presets locally
- `<all_urls>`: Required to fetch YouTube transcripts and call various APIs
