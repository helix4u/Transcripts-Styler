- **Permissions**: `storage` for preferences
- **Host Permissions**: `<all_urls>` for API access
- **Content Scripts**: Injected only on YouTube watch pages

### 2. Background Service Worker (background.js)
- **API Handlers**: LIST_TRACKS, FETCH_TRANSCRIPT, LLM_CALL, TTS_SPEAK
- **Provider Support**: OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenAI-compatible, Azure TTS
- **Security**: API keys never persisted, comprehensive logging
- **Error Handling**: Robust error management with detailed logging

### 3. Content Script (content.js)
- **Overlay UI**: Draggable, resizable interface with 8 main sections
- **Transcript Processing**: VTT/SRV3 parsing with intelligent merging
- **AI Integration**: Concurrent processing with progress tracking
- **TTS Support**: Multiple providers including browser synthesis
- **Export System**: TXT, SRT, VTT, JSON formats

### 4. Styling System (overlay.css)
- **Theming**: Dark, light, and system themes with CSS variables
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly with adaptive layouts

- **Modern UI**: Clean, professional interface design

## ✨ Key Features Implemented

### Transcript Extraction
- ✅ Automatic video ID detection
- ✅ Multi-language track support with preference ordering
- ✅ VTT and SRV3 XML format parsing
- ✅ Intelligent segment merging (0.25s threshold)
- ✅ Error handling for missing captions

### AI-Powered Restyling
- ✅ Multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenAI-compatible)
- ✅ Customizable prompt templates with variables
- ✅ Style presets (Professional, Casual, Academic, Creative, Technical)
- ✅ Concurrent processing (1-10 parallel requests)
- ✅ ASCII sanitization with OpenAI logit bias
- ✅ Real-time progress tracking with abort capability

### Text-to-Speech
- ✅ OpenAI TTS with voice selection
- ✅ Azure Speech Services with SSML support
- ✅ Browser TTS with system voices
- ✅ Custom FastAPI server support (Kokoro, XTTS, F5-TTS)
- ✅ Audio playback and download functionality

### Advanced Features

- ✅ Multi-language support with output language selection
- ✅ Debug logging system with key redaction
- ✅ Drag-and-drop overlay with position persistence
- ✅ Comprehensive theming system
- ✅ Search functionality within transcripts

### Export System
- ✅ TXT format with timestamps
- ✅ SRT subtitle format
- ✅ VTT WebVTT format
- ✅ JSON format with metadata
- ✅ Includes both original and restyled text

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

### Data Protection
- **API Keys**: Stored in memory only, never persisted
- **Transcripts**: Processed locally, only sent to chosen LLM provider
- **Preferences**: Saved locally using Chrome storage API
- **No Telemetry**: Zero data collection or tracking

### Permission Justification
- **Storage**: Required for saving user preferences and presets
- **Host Permissions**: Needed for YouTube transcript fetching and API calls
- **Content Scripts**: Only injected on YouTube watch pages

## 🚀 Technical Highlights

### Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading of UI components
- Efficient DOM manipulation with minimal reflows
- Debounced search functionality
- Smart caching of preferences and settings

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks throughout
- User-friendly error messages
- Detailed debug logging for troubleshooting
- Graceful degradation when features unavailable

### Code Quality
- ESLint configuration with strict rules
- Prettier formatting for consistency
- Comprehensive commenting and documentation
- Modular architecture with separation of concerns

## 🧪 Testing & Development
